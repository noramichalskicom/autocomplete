# autocomplete
Simple autocomplete function


This is where I am at right now (see uploaded files).

These are the features I would implement later on:

1. When user clicks on a suggested list item, the name of the product appears in input field. 
When the user hits enter, it directs the user to the url of that product.

2. When the user presses the up and down arrows, the user can navigate through the list items. Selects item with hitting enter.

3. I would refine the functionality that matches the input value with the data. Right now it gives sugestions if the input value has a match with the beginning of the product name. I would refine it, so, if the input value matches with any part of the product name, it would return it as suggestion.

4. Suggestions should be based on popularity, not on the data order in the json file. With more user info I could refine the functionality for that.

5. I would implement an option, where the user can select from the type of products in prior and/or after typing in the product name. Like on LinkedIn where you can set if the item that you are looking for is a person, a company, a group, a job, or something else. My experience is that is a very helpful functionality. 
Here we a lot of products with the same name, and, also, it's possible that the user wants to compare different products with the same type. This functionality would help the user to choose and compare products easier.

6. I could imagine a different way of visualizating the data if the matched products, the selected types or products would appear next/below the search field in a separate area. It would give the user more time to comprehend the information.

7. Styling: it is a nice experience if the match (or anything but the match) has a different font color or font-weight (etc.).

Thank you for the opportunity.
